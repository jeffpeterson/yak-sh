      <h1>Out of the Tar Pit</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity is <em>the</em> root cause of the vast majority of problems with software
today. Unreliability, late delivery, lack of security – often even poor
performance in large-scale systems can all be seen as deriving ultimately from
unmanageable complexity. The primary status of complexity as <em>the</em> major cause
of these other problems comes simply from the fact that being able to
<em>understand</em> a system is a prerequisite for avoiding all of them, and of
course it is this which complexity destroys.</p>
