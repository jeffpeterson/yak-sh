  &lt;p&gt;Complexity is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; root cause of the vast majority of problems with software
today. Unreliability, late delivery, lack of security – often even poor
performance in large-scale systems can all be seen as deriving ultimately from
unmanageable complexity. The primary status of complexity as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; major cause
of these other problems comes simply from the fact that being able to
&lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; a system is a prerequisite for avoiding all of them, and of
course it is this which complexity destroys.&lt;/p&gt;
