      <h1>Tips for a Healthy Conceptual Memory</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>See the things you’re learning as important and exciting.</strong> Our brains only
remember things of note. The more notable your thoughts, the better your
memory of it will be. See the beauty in what you’d like to learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integrate new learnings with older knowledge.</strong> Think of analogies. Think
of times when you would have found this new thing helpful. Ask yourself,
“What does this new concept remind me of?” Perhaps you already know this new
concept, but in different terms. Allow your mind to wander and explore!
Daydream!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Allow plurality.</strong> Try not to associate the concepts you learn with how
agreeable you find them. It’s important that you can hold memories that you
think are false. This way, even false things can contribute to a fuller
perspective. Darkness is more than the absence of light.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Allow contradictions.</strong> Many concepts held in your memory will contradict
each other. This is provably unavoidable. Contradictions are often very
interesting places to explore within your mind. “This sentence is false.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remove your value judgements.</strong> Don’t associate your emotional responses
with the perspectives you’re learning. Your values influence your memory, and
your memory determines your values. If you ever find yourself saying, “Oh, I
hate X… but I don’t remember specifically why,” you’ve probably made this
conflation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid causality.</strong> Think of things as being related, rather than one thing
causing the another. Correlation is more important than causality, and
causality is far more likely to change over time. Things also tend to happen
for a multitude of reasons. The best recipes have more than one ingredient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Separate conflations.</strong> When learning new things, we often begin to see old
concepts in a new way. It’s important that we use this to our advantage.
You’ll often have to retract connections that you made previously. Don’t trap
yourself in the box.</p>
  </li>
