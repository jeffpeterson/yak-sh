> Complexity is _the_ root cause of the vast majority of problems with
> software today. Unreliability, late delivery, lack of security --
> often even poor performance in large-scale systems can all be seen as
> deriving ultimately from unmanageable complexity. The primary status
> of complexity as _the_ major cause of these other problems comes simply
> from the fact that being able to _understand_ a system is a prerequisite
> for avoiding all of them, and of course it is this which complexity
> destroys.
